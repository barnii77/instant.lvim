An instant lunarvim setup built for a blank linux distro (if there is something on it, this might interfere with installed packages).

# TODO
- lunarvim clears the ~/.config/lvim folder when run for the first time, so make sure to clone repo there after first startup.
- Add nerdfont automatically
- Automatically add lunarvim alias lvim=~/.local/path/to/lvim to to ~/.bashrc 
- Add an information page that requires confirmation to continue and informs the user that the current launch of lunarvim is only a setup launch and the user should quit out of lvim after it's done
