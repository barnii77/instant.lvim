An instant lunarvim setup built for a blank linux distro (if there is something on it, this might interfere with installed packages).

# TODO
- lunarvim clears the ~/.config/lvim folder when run for the first time, so make sure to clone repo there after first startup.
- Add nerdfont automatically
- Automatically add lunarvim alias lvim=~/.local/path/to/lvim to to ~/.bashrc
